A project aimed to process 42 diseases' data (symptom wise) and build an application to predict diagnosis based on symptoms input

ipynb file has EDA and model training and test
(should be included as streamlit app showcase)

Tools to be used:
- Streamlit
- seaborn, pandas, scikit-learn

How it should work when finished:
- user goes to {app_name}.streamlit.app
- chooses the symptoms they have (checking the box? typing it and looking for symptoms?)
- submits info
- gets prognosis + accuracy rate
